            The goal of this project was to create a compressed air rocket capable of releasing a parachute once it has reached
            apogee. I was responsible for creating a sensor package that was able to detect temperature, acceleration and pressure in 
            order to determine when the rocket has reached apogee.

                    I worked on this project to determine the impact of Donald Trumps tweets on the stock market. My partner and I created
                    a twitterbot using python to collect all of Donald Trumps tweets since November 8th. We then exported all the raw data to a CSV file
                    where we began to analyze the data and look for patterns. As we continued to analyze the data we used a T-Test for statistical significance. 
                    The main test we conducted was to observe the average change on days with a relevant tweet versus the average change on days without. Our analysis proved
                    statistically significant in all 8 cases.

                    My partner and I presented this project at the Greater Vancouver Regional Science Fair in 2017. Our project was awarded a bronze medal, the UBC Statistics award and
                    a Computer Science Entrance Scholarship to UBC.

            <p>This was my year-end capstone project for my senior year of high school.
                I lead a team of three to create a smart doorbell system that would send a notification to the user's
                smartphone when someone has arrived at there door.
