                The concept of Dev Ops or agile software development, has always been an interest of mine. </br>The ability to continuously

                and improve feedback and automation.

                I have always been interested in starting my own company and building the foundations of an organization<br/> from the ground up.
                
                I have met several entrepreneurs and talked with them about the benefits and struggles of <br/>developing there own company, and I have learned 
                alot about the building blocks of creating a brand. <br/> I hope to one day start my own company with a group of my closest peers.
