            <p>
                The concept of Dev Ops or agile software development, has always been an interest of mine. The ability to continuously 
                integrate and deploy solutions while maintaining high software quality seemed like a foreign ideology when I first discovered it. 
                I believe that the concept of Dev Ops will be the future of Software Development simply because it will increase collaboration between teams 
                and improve feedback and automation.

            <p>Artificial intelligence has been a topic that I have been researching since High School. The concept of creating a self-aware machine that is capable of performing
                tasks without human guidance is fascinating.  </p>
