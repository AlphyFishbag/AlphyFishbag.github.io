                Hello, My name is Dexter Norris and I am currently a second year computer science student at the University of Victoria.
            Since i began my journey at university, I have been pursing my passion for problem-solving and technology.

    <p> At a young age, I found myself fascinated by technology. I built my first computer when I was 14 years old to become more familiar with computer
        hardware and software. It was an amazing learning experience and really helped motivate me to continue working on improving my skills. At 16 years old, I joined my school's STEM program
        which focused on math and physics and applying the skills we learned through project-based learning. This was an amazing opportunity that allowed me to truly pursue my passions in school
        and continue to learn new things. Through this program I was introduced to the linux operating system and the concept of open-source software. I started working on small projects 
        to apply the foundational skills I was learning in school.

        In my senior year of high school, I had decided that I wanted to pursue Computer Science at a post-secondary insitution. I started working on more complex projects that accelerated
        my learning. I took on a leadership role for my senior capstone project, leading a team of three we created a smart doorbell system
