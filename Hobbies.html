<div class="Snowboard_P">

    Snowboarding has been a huge part of my life since I moved to Vancouver. I began to snowboard competitively at 14 years old when I tried out for the BC Snowboard Development team.
    After a successful tryout I began to take snowboarding more seriously as I travelled around BC participating in various competitions. I picked up a few sponsors along the way who helped me raise funds for transportation 
    and contest entry fees.
