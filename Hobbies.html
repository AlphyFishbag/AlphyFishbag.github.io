<div class="Snowboard_P">

    Snowboarding has been a huge part of my life since I moved to Vancouver. I began to snowboard competitively at 14 years old when I tried out for the BC Snowboard Development team.<br/>
    After a successful tryout I began to take snowboarding more seriously as I travelled around BC participating in various competitions.<br/> I picked up a few sponsors along the way who helped me raise funds for transportation 
    and contest entry fees.

                Over the past few years I have had amazing opportunities to travel the world. Some notable places I have been to are Malaysia, Thailand and Mexico. <br/>
                I am very fortunate to have family all over the world and I am trying to visit them over the next few years. When I travelled to Malaysia I visited my Uncle 
                who is currently situated there for work.<br/> It was an amazing experience to learn about the different cultures that are present around the world.

        <p>Since my Junior year of high school, I have always believed that exercise and fitness can help improve mental health and 
            promote healthy habits.<br/> I have tried my best to stick with a consistent gym schedule for the past few years and to maintain a healthy diet.
            I am hoping that having easy access to a gym in University will help me stick with the schedule I created.
