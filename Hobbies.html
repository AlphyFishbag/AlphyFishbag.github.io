<div class="Snowboard_P">

    Snowboarding has been a huge part of my life since I moved to Vancouver. I began to snowboard competitively at 14 years old when I tried out for the BC Snowboard Development team.
    After a successful tryout I began to take snowboarding more seriously as I travelled around BC participating in various competitions. I picked up a few sponsors along the way who helped me raise funds for transportation 
    and contest entry fees.

                Over the past few years I have had amazing opportunities to travel the world. Some notable places I have been to are Malaysia, Thailand and Mexico. 
                I am very fortunate to have family all over the world and I am trying to visit them over the next few years. When I travelled to Malyasia I visited my Uncle 
                who is currently situated there for work. It was an amazing experience to learn about the different cultures and e
